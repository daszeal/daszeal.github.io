Question Mark 3 making its first successful non-simulated vertical landing on Kerbin.

**Advanced ?3 testing mission:**

Two unmanned ?3s were deployed into LKO where docking commenced.

Fuel was transfered from Spaceplane 2 to Spaceplane 1 to simulate reentry for empty tanks (e.g. during a Mun mission) and for full tanks (which is required for a Laythe mission).

The empty-tanked Spaceplane 2 was destoryed after reentry after losing control due to the mass of the engines making it tail-heavy. 

The full-tanked Spaceplane 1 was able to land on Kerbin successfully, then immediately took off to simulate Laythe ascent. 

After orbit insertion the vehicle managed to dock with the Blue Space Transfer Vehicle to simulate renzdevous with the Laythe mothership.

Spaceplane 1 then deorbited and reentered the atmosphere for the second time without maintainence. 

Reentry conditions were nominal, and enough oxidizer was left to successfully attempt a vertical landing.
