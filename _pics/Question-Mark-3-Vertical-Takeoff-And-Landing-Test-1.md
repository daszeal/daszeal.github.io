Latest Question Mark 3 (?3) variant testing its newly-added thrusters used for vertical landing.

Needs for a spaceplane capable of short-takeoff-and-vertical-landing arose when such landing maneuvers are required for low-gravity, atmosphere-less environments such as Minmus and the Mun.

Propulsive landing using the rear engines are possible but will require a landing directly on the vehicle's stern, potentially damaging engines and control surfaces. STOVL and VTOL planes are the perfect solution to land on landing gear.

Four Thud engines were added to its fuselage.
