First simulated test for the [landing burn throttle calculator](https://daszeal.github.io/tools/landing-burn-calculator/). Results were very good, but required regular updating of all fillable fields to account for mass changes. Also, the downrange distance was eyeballed but the flight path angle was not, resulting in inaccuracies. Accuracy for throttle was also affected by the mechanical limits of the KSP throttle, which is purely hand-controlled to around a 5% range of error.

Probe successfully cut all its velocity 15m above the surface.
